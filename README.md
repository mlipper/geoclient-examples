# geoclient-examples

Example code in various languages for calling the Geoclient REST API.

Most of the code examples depend on an environment variable named `GEOCLIENT_KEY` to discover the value of your subscription key.
Make sure the `GEOCLIENT_KEY` environment variable is set with a valid subscription key before running the code.

Here's an example of setting the variable that will work from most Unix/Linux shells.

```sh
export GEOCLIENT_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Similarly, examples check for a variable named `GEOCLIENT_URL` allowing you to override the default for the Geoclient v2 base endpoint URL: [`https://api.nyc.gov/geoclient/v2`](https://api.nyc.gov/geoclient/v2).
Setting this variable is NOT required but may be useful if, for example, you a running Geoclient behind an `APIM` on your own servers:    

```sh
export GEOCLIENT_URL=https://nyc-geocode-service.com/geoclient/v2
```

## Authentication Examples

The `auth/` contains examples showing how to submit your subscription key with each request. Most of the examples provide the key in the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` HTTP header.
Files suffixed with `-qs` (`<file_name>-qs.<file_extension>`) show how to make the call by adding the `key` query string parameter instead.

## Geoclient Python Examples

**WARNING:** The samples in this directory may not work! They are copied from various micro projects written for older Python and Geoclient versions. They will be fixed soon...

### Usage

```python

pip3 install petl
...

python3 <file>.py

```

If python3/pip3 has been aliased to python/pip, then this will also work:

```python

pip install petl
...
python <file>.py

```

### Assumptions

* Python 3.10 or greater (3.8, 3.9 will probably work).
* The `petl` library has been installed (`pip3 install petl`).
* The `*.py` files are in the same directory as the `*.csv` files.

Only applies to the DSNY example:

* The code is run from a terminal that supports 8-bit ANSI color codes. It
  has been tested with `sh` and `bash`, but `cmd.exe` should work.

### OMB Building Geocoder

This example demonstrates geocoding addresses assembled from multiple columns
and writing results to an output file. Both input (UTF-8 encoded, exported by
Excel) and output (ASCII) files are in `CSV` format.

The code also shows how to preserve row identifiers from the input data so
that the geocoded attributes in output rows can be correlated with input data.

### DSNY Data Verification

This code was originally written to verify that a particular DCP Geosupport
release was using updated DSNY district values for certain locations.

At this time, some of those values have changed so it is **expected** that
some tests will fail.

### NYC Developer Portal

This example demonstrates using the popular python `requests` project and
`json` built-in module to call `geoclient v1` through NYC Developer Portal's
API Gateway.
